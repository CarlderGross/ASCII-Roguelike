This game is INCOMPATIBLE with Windows. A Unix terminal, or other terminal that accepts ANSI command codes, is required for it to work.

Can't find the Amulet of Yendor? Don't worry, it's not just you. It's on the 101st level of the dungeon, but unfortunately that's unreachable at the moment.

To start a new game, type #wipesave. This will delete all save files and exit the game.

It is recommended to play this with a numpad, since movement uses the numpad numbers.

Type #help for more help.
